# Mod2_Assignment1
This is the first assignment in Module 2 for MET CS 633
I am very excited for the project, and have found this class and material extremely interesting so far.
It is very timely as my organization is approaching the acceptance phase of an implementation. 
It makes me wish I had taken this class sooner!
It would have been very helpful!
